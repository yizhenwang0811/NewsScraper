is expected to be in singapore for the talks on tuesday, pompeo has taken the lead as the administration assumes a softer tone toward pyongyang ahead of the summit, several u.s. officials said. pompeo\u2019s ascendance combined with bolton\u2019s more muted public role illustrates how the sometimes messy power dynamic in trump\u2019s inner circle has played out going into the first-ever meeting between u.s. and north korean leaders. but trump\u2019s ability to deliver the biggest foreign policy success of his presidency could rest heavily on the team he has hastily cobbled together to advise him after announcing in march he was prepared to meet kim in an effort to persuade the north korean leader to give up a nuclear arsenal that now threatens the united states. \u201cthis summit is being thrown together faster than any we\u2019ve ever seen for something this important,\u201d said one u.s. official, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cso unless we want the president to get played by kim, a lot rests with the team that\u2019s putting this all together.\u201d pompeo, first as trump\u2019s cia director and now as his chief diplomat, quickly made north korea his main focus. but even as pompeo was launching delicate diplomacy, bolton \u2013 an outspoken former u.n. ambassador with a history of fraught dealings with pyongyang - took up his post and began pushing a tougher approach to north korea that he has long advocated. never was that clearer than when bolton went on television on may 13, just days after pompeo returned from a second visit to pyongyang, and pressed north korea to follow the \u201clibya model\u201d in nuclear negotiations. libya unilaterally surrendered its nuclear weapons program in 2003, but its leader, muammar gaddafi, was killed in 2011 by nato-backed rebels. bolton\u2019s demand angered north korea, which threatened to pull out of the summit. trump, who according to one u.s. official was furious that bolton had made the libya comparison, sought to salvage the meeting by disavowing his remarks. but north korea responded harshly. trump on may 24 then canceled the summit, only to reinstate it a week later after meeting a north korean envoy at the white house, where the president appeared to back away from his demand for pyongyang\u2019s swift, complete denuclearization. bolton \u2013 once denounced by north korea as \u201chuman scum\u201d during his days at the state department under former president george w. bush - was conspicuously absent from the oval office encounter, raising speculation he was sidelined. the white house did not respond to a request for comment. trump, however, has not frozen bolton out on north korea and he remains a key player, according to multiple u.s. officials. bolton, known as a skilled bureaucratic operator, has \u201ctaken the hint\u201d to assume a lower profile and is mindful that his earlier clashes with pyongyang could cause problems that should be avoided, one of the officials said. before taking office, bolton openly advocated north korean \u201cregime change.\u201d bolton has not commented publicly since the president distanced himself from the libya comparison and the white house insisted he would follow the \u201ctrump model.\u201d despite that, white house adviser kellyanne conway said on wednesday that bolton would travel to singapore. \u201csecretary of state pompeo has clearly taken the lead on the negotiations,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cbut the national security adviser is going, he\u2019s going to singapore and will be part of the talks.\u201d pompeo initially developed a rapport with trump by delivering his morning intelligence briefings. trump\u2019s faith in pompeo is seen as a key factor for entrusting him with the north korea portfolio. but some u.s. officials and analysts have expressed concern about what they see as the former republican congressman\u2019s habit of telling trump what he wants to hear. suzanne dimaggio, a senior fellow at the new america foundation think tank, suggested that if negotiations soured, \u201cthen we have mr. bolton looming in the background, ready to jump in.\u201d also expected to play an important role on trump\u2019s summit team is matt pottinger, trump\u2019s asia adviser who reports to bolton at the national security council. the former journalist and ex-u.s. marine has helped coordinate north korea policy and is seen by korea watchers as a pragmatic voice. sung kim, a veteran diplomat serving as ambassador to the philippines, was called in to lead a small delegation that met in recent days with north korean officials in the demilitarized zone between the koreas to discuss the summit agenda. he is an ex-ambassador to seoul and a former nuclear negotiator with pyongyang. it was a reminder the administration remains short on asia expertise, especially after the departure of north korea negotiator joseph yun, delays in getting in place a new ambassador to south korea and the lack of a senate-confirmed top diplomat for east asia. reporting by matt spetalnick and david brunnstrom; additional reporting by john walcott and steve holland; editing by mary milliken and peter cooney", "summary_gensim": "washington (reuters) -

disputes with u.s. president donald trump over trade and the looming election, as well as the strong u.s. currency. urzua, who described a lopez obrador government as being to the right of the administration of former brazilian leftist leader luiz inacio \u2018lula\u2019 da silva, said he did not believe trump would scrap the north american free trade agreement, because such a move would be \u201cdisastrous\u201d for mexico, canada and the united states. \u201cit would be crazy,\u201d he said in the interview conducted in english. \u201cit would be remembered as the last step for the economic empire to collapse. you cannot isolate yourself.\u201d the team is ready to \u201ctake the baton\u201d on renegotiating nafta, urzua said, noting that a deal was unlikely before dec. 1, when a new government will take office. lopez obrador\u2019s trade negotiators, due to be led by former world trade organization deputy director-general jesus seade, mostly share the current mexican government\u2019s view of the country\u2019s interests in the talks, urzua said. urzua said he had met with u.s. treasury department and national security council officials in washington recent weeks. he said graciela marquez, who lopez obrador says would be his economy minister overseeing trade talks, had also met officials. a 62-year-old economist, urzua is an old friend of the former mexico city mayor, and served as his finance minister in the capital. he teaches a course on economic growth at the tecnologico de monterrey university. in government, they would target growth of around 5 percent by the end of the six-year term, led by public and private investment in trains, ports and roads. last year, mexico\u2019s economy grew 2 percent. to keep a cap on promised social spending, they plan to clamp down on waste and corruption in government procurement. if they do not find the money to fund their social spending plans, they will make cuts instead, urzua said. \u201conce you take (into account) interest payments and amortization, we would never have a deficit,\u201d he said. he said lopez obrador was committed to running a primary budget surplus of 0.5 to 1 percent. \u201ci\u2019m less fiscally conservative than lopez obrador. and i\u2019m a little bit conservative. but he\u2019s extremely careful,\u201d urzua said, describing himself as \u201ccenter-right\u201d on debt. the same was not true of lopez obrador\u2019s views on the oil industry, urzua said. his government would put the brakes on foreign investment in the sector spurred under a reform passed by the government of outgoing president enrique pena nieto. obrador would freeze auctions of oilfields in the gulf of mexico until he was sure no corruption had been involved in issuing contracts to oil companies, urzua said. \u201cthen he will decide whether he will continue with the auction process ... or not,\u201d he said. but there was no reason to believe there was anything wrong with how they were issued, in a process widely viewed as transparent, he said. existing contracts would be respected, he added. reporting by jean yoon, paritosh bansal, daniel flynn, dave graham and frank jack daniel;
